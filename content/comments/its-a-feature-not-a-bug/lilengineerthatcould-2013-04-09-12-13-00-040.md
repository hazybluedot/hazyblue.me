Thanks for your comment! I think if you had asked this a couple weeks ago I wouldn’t have been able to come up with a satisfying response and I’d come off as a Linux fanboy or something. Luckily I was just having a conversation about some of these themes, notably the Internet vs. the web vs. Facebook, and it all relates. That being said, you are exactly right about pointing out my inconsistent view regarding Android vs. iOS because…

I think of *nix both as an actual class of operating systems which share a number of technical features, but also as a philosophy. I strongly believe that certain core elements of the philosophy are what have allows *nix systems to adapt and expand and thrive in today’s tech environment. One of those critical elements is the openness of the technology, both in terms of source code (as very early Unix was by nature of the legal environment surrounding AT&T at the time) and as Linux continues to be, but also in terms of the openness of the environment itself as seen by the user.

OS X is an example of a “technically *nix but not philosophically *nix” system. Apple took built OS X on top of a base system that owed its existence and maturity to a philosophy of openness, but did embody the same philosophy.

Yes, OS X, iOS and Android all provide “walled garden” access to the machine, and as you mentioned in some cases this is a good thing, but the Android project itself does contribute back to the community originally responsible for enabling Android.

Many hardcore Linux users have negative issues associated with the Walled Garden approach Ubuntu is taking, but I tend to agree, if Linux is ever going to reach widespread desktop use, it will be in a form more similar to Ubuntu than Gentoo. That being said, while Ubuntu doesn’t advertise it, it is still fairly straight forward to experiment with it like any other distribution, presenting the same type of flexibility for choosing which graphical environment to use (although I’ve heard that completely removing Unity from the system can cause issues with future software updates being applied correctly), and how to interact with the system (you can still work entirely from the shell, if you wanted to).
