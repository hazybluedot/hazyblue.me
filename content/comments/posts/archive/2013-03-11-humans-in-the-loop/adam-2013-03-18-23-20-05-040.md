I have recently begun dipping my toes into programming. I think it should be something I am familiar with and literate in so as not to be left behind in the digital world. I have noticed this though, that some things that are seemingly very easy to convey in our language, with our many algorithms running running parallel to one another, are very difficult to instruct a computer to do, even in the more user friendly languages. 

I am excited for Jarvis but I agree that before we can create new brains we probably need to understand our own much more fully than we do now.
