This was probably one of my favorite posts of the semester. I read it a month or two ago and I keep thinking about it. I like how you explained the algorithms using the descriptive, human readable code. Really got me thinking about how algorithms/data analysis can be used to find patterns in society that one person may not be able to find on their own.
