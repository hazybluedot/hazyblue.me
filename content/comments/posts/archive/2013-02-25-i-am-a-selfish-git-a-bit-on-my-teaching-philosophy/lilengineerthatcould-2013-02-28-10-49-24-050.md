Armaun, this opens up a really important discussion: what is the point of going to college?  It bugs me to no end that the engineering curriculum is set up in a way to discourage, or at least make it difficult to have these discussions in class.  Luckily we have blogging, which can stand in until the department comes to its senses and starts talking about this stuff.

I don't see college as a centralized hub of information, and if that were all it were it would be a complete rip off considering current tuition rates. A library is certainly a hub of information, and now tools built on top of the Internet are also hubs of information, and for the most part there are plenty of really excellent hubs available to everyone for free (plus the cost of an internet connection, in some cases).

I think of college as a breeding ground of new ideas.  It's a place where many of us can come together and share bits of information that we have found on one of the many available hubs, and form new connections between pieces that we didn't realize were connected.  That process is a critically important component of education, without it, all we would learn is how to recite pieces of information that were given to us.

A more concrete example (and as a preface, this is of course based on my own opinion and personal set of experiences, I welcome and encourage anyone to share their thoughts, especially if they contradict with my own):  What's the use of learning, say Python, as a specific example?  It is one particular language that happens to be fairly popular right now.  It has a ton of loadable modules that can be used to make fairly complex tasks simple.  We might think then, to become better programmers we should memorize all the modules available to Python, what they do, the exact syntax, so that when faced with a problem we can sit down and whip out some Python code, bam solved.  Then we get a job.

Me: I'm so excited to be working here, I am an expert in Python, I can't wait to solve all our company's problems with awesome Python code.
Boss: oh. well, we switch to Ruby last year.
Me: Oh? How do I program in Ruby? What about all these Python modules I memorized, was that a waste of time?
Boss: Probably, here's a book.

Learning something like Python has only a limited amount of value.  Even *if* you end up using Python later on, the modules will always be updated, changing, code you wrote a year ago might not work exactly the same way on a different machine with a newer version of Python.  The world is a very dynamic place, we can't tackle it with only a memorized list of information.

Learning how to learn a new language is infinitely more valuable.  It's the difference between "Oh, Ruby? What's that?" to "great, I love new languages, I'll get something written up in a week".  Going out into the wilds of the web and searching for how best to handle error handling in Python does two things, one, it helps hone skills needed to sift through the wealth of information that is freely available to us, and it helps form connections between different languages (or even entirely different ideas that seem unrelated), "oh, Python uses exceptions, so does C++, do the two differ wildly, or can I use what I know about C++ exception handling to aid my understanding of exception handling in Python?").

One thing that troubles me about the direction I think I see the department (and from what I gather, other engineering departments) going is that they seem to be morphing into vocational schools.  Vocational schools are great assets to society, and they provide a valuable and important service.  They also tend be a good deal cheaper.  It's a critically important role to have, but a different role from a university.  I think it has been particularly easy for engineering to get funneled down this path due to the inherent connection between engineering and industry.  That connection, of course, is vital, but if it becomes the only connection that receives any attention we will lose our ability to innovate, our ability to create radically new things and to solve problems we've never encountered before. And in a world with increasingly complex and changing problems that absolutely need to be solved, that thought is very concerning.
