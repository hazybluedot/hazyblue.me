While your philosophy teaches us more since we have to research it, isn't the point of me going to college having that centralized hub of information? Telling me to go Google it and then I get no or bad answers (not uncommon) pretty much defeats that purpose. And I also don't learn when I ask a question for every problem I encounter. I learn how to avoid those problems, not do the work. The main problem seems to be that you give us no tools. When I come to class, I expect it to be relevant to something of mine that is graded. If it doesn't, why even bother going? I'm not saying to tell us how to do something. But even bringing up the concept of error catching in languages most of us have never used would have been helpful.
