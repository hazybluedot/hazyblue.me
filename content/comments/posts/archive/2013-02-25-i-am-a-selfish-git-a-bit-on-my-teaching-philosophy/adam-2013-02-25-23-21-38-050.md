I really like your "learn by doing" approach to teaching. I must admit I don't understand a fair amount of the more specialized language in many of your posts. I think it is fantastic though because I end up googling the stuff I don't know and learning more about a new topic. You seem to have inadvertently applied your teaching method to your blogging method as well with a positive outcome (at least for me).
