Lukas, I'm glad you can relate, often times I wonder if I'm just a freak of engineer, but then again, we seldom talk about world views and self philosophies in engineering, so how would I even know?

Adam, yes, it was certainly inspired by Dawkin's concept of mimetic evolution.  I really liked that idea, and the connection to genetic evolution.  It provides a consistent means to connect the two notions and be able to transition from "the point of life is to sustain itself" to "the point of life is to sustain the message"
