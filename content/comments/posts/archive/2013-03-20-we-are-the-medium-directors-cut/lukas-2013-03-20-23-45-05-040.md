Great post.

I have had similar thoughts. My major follow-up question was the purpose of being a vessel, but eventually that became a source of great joy, because there is no end goal or final point, we are on a perpetual journey of untangling the greatest puzzle of the world, we really are vessels that are filled with created things that enrich our world.

Knowing, that even after my short time has ended I have left information behind, a presence that will forever linger in the surroundings makes life worth it and exciting. It makes me want to see everything that everyone has done and I want to do something myself, because in the end something is as meaningful as we assign it to be. In a sense, we are the greatest creators, since we all posses the power to create, destroy and imagine.

I immediately think of this post https://plus.google.com/112218872649456413744/posts/dfydM2Cnepe and man similar ones.
