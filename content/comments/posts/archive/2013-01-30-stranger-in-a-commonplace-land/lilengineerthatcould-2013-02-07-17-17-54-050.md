I think interface design lies on the interface between engineering, art, psychology and increasingly in our networked world, sociology.  I think too often engineers consider their job complete once they have created something functional.  I suspect that there is no greater concentration of hostility towards Apple than in the computer engineering department. "There products are over priced, for what they are, you can get the same specs from other companies for a lot less", is an argument I hear a lot. I think at least some of the people who make these arguments are legitimately baffled why someone would choose to spend hundreds more for "the same hardware" that was available elsewhere for cheaper.  So yes, I understand why you ask that question because many engineers don't seem to see the interface design as part of there job, or even necessarily an important aspect of a product, they don't seem to quite grok that Apple isn't marketing computer hardware, they're marketing a user experience.  

I don't want to dwell on Apple too much, that's just seems to be a common sore spot for a lot of people I interact with, and I suspect some of the hostility comes from the confusion as to why clearly people seem to care about what Apple is doing, even though nothing they are doing is incredibly original.  Honestly, engineering, or at least the engineering curriculum has been or has become too isolated from the world in which its products are used I think.
