I would be interested in hearing who the stranger is in this Commonplace land?

“Are we becoming a species obsessed with living in the moment and unable to live any other way?”

I am interested in exploring if a lack of planning and last minute scrambling to put together your plans for the evening or weekend’s festivities is really living in the moment.  To me living in the moment is embracing engagement with the present on such a deep level that you are unaware (in the moment) that you are fully engaged with the moment.  The moment you realize both your tires just lost traction as you round a curve on your mountain bike is a moment you must fully engage with.  If you were contemplative about that moment you would fall.  Instead you need to trust your body to simply react.    Playing a game of tennis, kissing a woman or man you are in love with, or laughing at a good joke your friend just cracked are times to live in the moment.  Has the cell phone and other “new” technologies helped us embrace this attitude? Or have they done something else?
