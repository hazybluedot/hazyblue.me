"any good engineer knows that if a piece of technology is doing its job, it should be transparent to the user."

I am very glad you feel this way. In my study of architecture, and by extension design in general, I see this disappearing act of technology essential. I was wondering if you consider user experience design under the heading of engineering? It is one thing to create a device that allows me to download a book anywhere, but is is another thing entirely to consider the possibilities of a new format of media consumption in terms of the experience of the user. Infinite scrolling is one of my favorites, but is by no means the most revolutionary re-imagining of format on the web.
