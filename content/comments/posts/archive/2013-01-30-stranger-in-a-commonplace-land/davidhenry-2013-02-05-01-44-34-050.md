As I understand it correctly a piece of technology that is transparent to the user is one that the user is unaware that they are using.  Douglas Adams made the argument that “Before long, computers will be as trivial and plentiful as chairs (and a couple of decades or so after that, as sheets of paper or grains of sand) and we will cease to be aware of the things”
Would you consider chairs to be a transparent technology?  How about the more modern TV?  How long until the device I am using to type these words is no longer something I view as a new technology but instead a fact of modern life?  Are we already there?
