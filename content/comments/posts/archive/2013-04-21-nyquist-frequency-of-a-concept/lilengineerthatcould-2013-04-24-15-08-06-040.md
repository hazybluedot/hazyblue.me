It does seem that being "mind to mind" would be the ultimate communication experience, although after writing the above post I wonder if it would always be desirable.  It does seem that many intellectual leaps are made as a result or side effect of our less-than-perfect communication.  One example that comes to mind is that of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Dantzig" rel="nofollow">George Dantzig</a> who proved a couple of "unsolvable" theorems in statistics because he showed up late and missed the part about them being unsolvable. 
On the flip side, for truly sharing an experience (what did if FEEL like, when George Dantzig was told he had solved a couple of famously unsolved proofs?), perhaps the "mind to mind" link would be superior, but even then, I wonder if the act of us trying to put that feeling to words/paint/photographs/media is crucial for our own understanding of our experience.
