"OS X is an example of a 'technically *nix but not philosophically *nix' system."

That's a really interesting way of looking at it - thanks for explaining.

I guess I'm unconcerned about not having the sources for OS X because it already works the way I want it to work, which leaves me to tinker with things I want to tinker with. I used Linux for a while, and it gave me the good habit of working from the shell, which I've kept up since my return to OS X. But it's a huge relief not to have to worry any more about hardware drivers (I had issues with my graphics card, with my sound card, with wifi etc). From a hacker's point of view, I know this is the wrong attitude.

I feel the opposite way about my Android phone. It doesn't work the way I want it to, so I'd love to tinker with it - but I can't. I could get the source for the kernel, but it's not the kernel I have issues with: it's all the garbage that Samsung dumped on top. Maybe this is the sort of thing discussed in the article you mention?

Anyway, I too am very interested in the Ubuntu phone. It sounds like a much, much better idea than Android - but I worry that it's come to the party too late.
