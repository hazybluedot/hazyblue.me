This reminds me of something that I've often experienced both in the real and virtual worlds. As a woman, I tend to notice sexist comments, both the unintentional and the blatant. When I point these out, there's one particular type of response that reallllly rubs me the wrong way... 

"I was just joking. Can't you take a joke?! Why are you so serious?"

Serious? I'm not serious. I spent most of my life laughing. I tell jokes. Clean ones. Dirty ones. One's that are based on puns that a five year old could understand. One's that there is no way that I would ever share with my grandmother. I can tell a joke. I can take a joke. 

What they're doing isn't joking. 

What they've done is made a statement that's inappropriate. Because, as you said, they are speaking from a place of privilege. And it's understandable that they have that privilege, and it's understandable that they don't really understand why what they're saying is inappropriate. What is not okay is that they use the shield of humor to try and cut off criticism. Because there's basically nothing you can say back, or you end up as just the bitch without a sense of humor. I still don't have a good way of dealing with it, but that doesn't stop it from royally pissing me off.
