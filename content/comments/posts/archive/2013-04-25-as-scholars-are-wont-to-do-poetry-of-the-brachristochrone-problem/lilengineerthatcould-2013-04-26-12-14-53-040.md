In the paper I linked in footnote 2, which was originally a broken link but now is fixed, the authors quote Stinner and Williams on Large Context Problems: ‘the LCP approach provides a vehicle for traversing what Whitehead (1967) refers to as "the path from romance to precision to generalization"(p. 19).’

This of course also lead me to checkout a copy of Whitehead's "The Aims of Education and other essays" from the library, and order a copy from Amazon.  Luckily, there are <a href="http://addison.vt.edu/search~S1?/cQ181+.I6557+1998/cq+++181+i6557+1998/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CE/frameset&amp;FF=cq+++181+i6557+1998&amp;1%2C1%2C" rel="nofollow">two copies</a> of the Stinner and Williams source at the library, so we don't even need to fight over it.
