Magnificent post. I'm especially grateful to learn about Large Context Problems. I'm putting that in the Scholars Are Wont To Do bag with wicked problems and Bateson's discussion of ecology (and the intellectual ecology that springs up around the idea of ecology #recursionalert).

In a word, thanks.
