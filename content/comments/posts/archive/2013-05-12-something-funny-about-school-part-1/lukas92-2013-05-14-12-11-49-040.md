This offers a really good description of the curriculum. I heard that some other universities have a more open curriculum, with just a few core classes and the majority being up for decision of the student.

And there is also the fact that most students don't know what to take, so they want the decision be made for them, which probably could be solved with a recommended curriculum path, and giving students who know what they want a more flexible approach.
