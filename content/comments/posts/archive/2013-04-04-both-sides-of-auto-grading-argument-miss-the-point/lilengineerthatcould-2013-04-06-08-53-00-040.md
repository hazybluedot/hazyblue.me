I disagree with the quote primarily because it *doesn’t* mention AI at all. They say *computers* cannot read, cannot measure the essentials of communication, etc. I find this argument rather weak and … you probably can think of the word more quickly than I can look it up. It is written as though they expect their readers to immediately see “computers cannot read” and go “well OF COURSE they can’t read, they’re just machines!” when in fact that is a false argument. Our brains are machines too: the reason current AI programs still can’t match the quality of reading comprehension of humans has more to do with our lack of understanding of how *we* read and comprehend rather than any inherit limitation of the technology itself. Yes, the fact that we don’t understand well enough how we comprehend written language is a valid argument to make in saying any AI we build won’t be as good as a human grader. That’s not the argument I see them making.

But in the end, like my title says, I find the details of that argument somewhat distracting (though, naturally, I think AI reading comprehension is a really exciting area of research now and we should continue pursuing it as it will teach us more about ourselves).

And I’m not sure I would say with confidence that students can’t and don’t game human graders. Especially when one human has 100 papers to read through, it’s going to be easy to miss those written as “this is what I think the grader want’s to see” rather than “this is my understanding of the topic”
