I don’t know that i agree with your objection to the PAMSEHSA quote. The second sentence makes pretty clear what is meant by the first: that “reading” as we understand it in pedagogy involves much more than scanning, but the leveraging of many comprehension, integration, and balancing skills. It seems like fine communication because it launches from the widely shared perception (which i’d taken to be true?) that such skills are understood to be well beyond the reach of contemporary AI. (You seem to confirm this with your later characterization of a grading AI as something that any college student could game.) Am i misreading you?

I thoroughly agree with your reciprocal point. An embarrassingly large proportion of my education has been what i’ve learned about a familiar subject through tutoring people in it…and that’s just the subject matter.
