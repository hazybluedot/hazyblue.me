I think that a lot of people don't realize the scope of what projects they'll be working on in the professional industry. Even coding projects in senior-level classes are just a tiny fragment of the complexity and size of applications that companies in the commercial and defense industry develop. The best analogy I can think of is writing a 5-10 page short story versus working collaboratively on a set of novels.

The way we use our computers at home is very different from what will go on in a development environment. Most everything can be done from a GUI for the average consumer or home user, but is not practical in an IT or development setting.
