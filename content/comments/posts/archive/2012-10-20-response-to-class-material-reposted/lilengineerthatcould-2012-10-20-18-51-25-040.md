Those are great examples Matt.  The remote-access thing in particular is something I've been trying to figure out how to integrate into the class.  The main problem has been that the server space that I know everyone has access to (cvl.ece.vt.edu) is running quite outdated software (both Python and gcc) and I feel that trying to get everyone to compile newer versions of the software may be more work than it's worth.  Perhaps it would still be beneficial to come up with a few assignments that don't rely on newer features of Python or gcc and make use of that resource.
