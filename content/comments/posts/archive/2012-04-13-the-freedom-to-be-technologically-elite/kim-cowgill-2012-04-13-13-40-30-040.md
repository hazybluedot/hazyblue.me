Yeah! I bow humbly before this info... thanks for sharing. I've been pondering this a little... especially my use of the word "elite"... and I suppose it's similar to those who had the power to manage written information before everyone could read. Maybe I personally feel so disconnected from these tools that you mentioned because I don't know them, and I'm pretty sure I never will. That's not to say that I don't think I could learn those languages if I had to, I just choose to direct my energies elsewhere. Again... Shelli's agency, right?? 

I admit that I bring a lot of baggage to this conversation, some of which I plan to spell out in my next post... which hopefully won't sound to whiny. I'm working on it.

Anyway - thanks for reading, engaging, communicating. I definitely value your opinion!
