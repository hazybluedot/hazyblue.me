dkm: For first point, I was mainly referring to the undergrad program here. I don’t know how the graduate level is handled, but I’m kind of disappointed in the undergrad level. It’s just too scattered. I agree a lot more weight should be given to things in this class, but ultimately, the ECE department hasn’t. Maybe if we get some actual people in industry to talk to them about it they’ll be quicker to change their minds.

I remember the guy who showed up at the mentor meeting saying that this class was important (anybody else remember him? I forget his name). Maybe we could get him on our side (for a start) and convince them that this stuff is really important (because it’s more important given how prevalent computers are, and they offer valuable skills no matter what field you’re in).
