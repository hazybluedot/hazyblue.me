The feedback has been great, thanks everyone!

Ben: Thank you, that means a lot, and to be honest I wasn’t really sure how you liked the course. I know it’s always been a bit disorganized and unstructured, there are some aspects of that that I like (it’s easier to spend more time on things that need more time when there isn’t a strict schedule looking over your shoulder, but on the other hand it can feel kind of all over the place at times. I like to think each semester it is evolving to something closer to something that works well for everyone.

Zack: That’s an excellent point and perhaps in my enthusiastic frenzy of restructuring the curriculum I didn’t give enough though to where some of the formal programming concepts will come in. I like to think that many could be introduced in the context of exploring other material by writing programs, but there very well be a need for a strong need for a dedicated programming fundamentals course or series of courses. Even then, I think those could make use of other engineering material for motivating examples.

James: That’s a really great observation, and reading that I think gives some insight as to why ECE2524 itself feels kind of all over the place at times. There is just too many topics that we’re told we “need” to understand before getting that degree. It’s worth noting that the graduate program is a bit different: for one we get to pick and choose which classes we take (though there are some “strongly recommended” courses which vary depending on who your adviser is) and there are several subareas to help focus the that process:
Electrical Engineering

Communications
Electromagnetics
Electronics/Circuits
Signals, Systems, and Control
Power

Computer Engineering

Computer Systems
Networking
Software and Machine Intelligence
VLSI and Design Automation

I forget the exact numbers, but there are some guidelines like “x credits from within your sub-area” and then it’s mostly “a certain portion of the rest should come from ECE, a smaller number may come from different departments” but even then the rules aren’t always strict, usually it’s just a matter of getting your committee to approve, so if you find a great course in some other department you can usually get it to count towards your graduation credits with just a few signatures.
The number of people going through the undergraduate curriculum is of course much higher, so maybe it’s not feasible to demand that exact same system, but it seems like there should at least be a way to have several different paths laid out for each of the sub areas. It would be interesting to find out how much of the current structure is due to ABET accrediting rules and how much is due to just “this it’s how it’s always been done, dammit”. I wonder who is actually deciding what an EE or CpE should “know” after getting their degree?

I definitely think we should investigate how we might open up a conversation with the department, I’ll ask around about any formal procedure for this kind of thing, and you do as well! If there isn’t one, a nice “open letter to the dean” might be a good place to start.
