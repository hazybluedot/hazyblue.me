I agree with you in that programming should be applied in the learning process of our classes more. Analyzing and dissecting a problem to answer it in code is quite honestly the best way to learn. I didn't see the beauty of Newton's law of gravitation until I could see it's effects in an orbiting body simulator that I wrote. Beyond all this however, it should go without saying that a very solid background in programming is necessary for all computer engineers here. The difference between a single file C++ project from ECE 1574 and a thousand file project across multiple languages from the real world is enormous. It is quite drastic and overwhelming. Adjusting to it in the three years time from taking ECE 1574 to graduating isn't exactly an easy process. I feel that basic concepts of programming should be taught to us earlier. Even those who won't follow a career in computers can use programming to benefit their learning of other concepts.
