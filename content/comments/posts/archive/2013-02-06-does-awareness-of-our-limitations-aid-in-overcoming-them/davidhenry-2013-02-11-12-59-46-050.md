“We view the future through a lens designed by history and crafted in the present”
I wonder if before the invention of the printing press there was something that could be compared to science fiction.  What were people saying about the future before you could easily use the written language as a means of communication?  Did the oral traditions and stories of different cultures explore potential futures beyond the explanation that their religion offered them?  I bring this up because the transformation we are currently undergoing has been compared to impact that the invention of the printing press had on society.  Fully overcoming our limitations to make conceptual leaps may be impossible but technology seems to be helping people express themselves and through that expression they can make their ideas known.  A problem that may develop is that such a body of ideas and potential future states are created that wading through that information becomes almost impossible.  If 10,000 potential futures are presented instead of 10 can we effectively and accurately determine which ones might be most probable or will our lens on the future be forever clouded by historical facts and scratched by the battles of the present.
