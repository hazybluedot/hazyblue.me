## Goodbye Wordpress ##

For the past two years I have been using Virginia Tech's
[Blogs@VT](https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/) service to host my blog. It's
been nice and all, but my goal had always been to move away from the
VT hosted option and away from [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org)
too. It's not that I don't appreciate all that Blogs@VT or WordPress
has done: I think Blogs@VT is an excellent service providing
easy-access blog hosting to the Virginia Tech community (though they
really should fix whatever is making
[this hack](https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/support/2012/11/27/faq-i-cant-access-or-feed-out-my-posts-by-category/)
necessary to get tag feeds), and WordPress is fine for what it does,
but there were a few things that bugged me, mostly relating to the...

<!-- more -->

- UI and work-flow. As a WordPress blogger I was pretty much forced to
  use the WordPress interface for entering content, which is kind of
  crummy if you want to do anything other than add elements that had
  buttons associated with them.  The text mode interface is almost not
  worth the effort, as it seems to allow HTML tags, but does some
  extra parsing that makes it a pain to copy and paste HTML generated
  elsewhere: WordPress seems to replace empty lines with `<br/>` tags,
  which is incredibly annoying when the code you're pasting in has
  been hard-wrapped to 80 columns. Either be a straight forward HTML
  pass through, OR assume some kind of well established markup syntax
  such as [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/).

- speed. WordPress is a dynamic site generator. The actual data for
  the posts is stored in a database somewhere and HTML pages are
  created on the fly when a visitor requests a particular
  resource. This isn't a major issue with today's internet and
  computer speeds, but for something like a simple blog that serves up
  mostly static content WordPress can feel sluggish at
  times. Especially, I found, when syndicating a lot of feeds, such as
  on a [mother blog](http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/ece2524s13).

- code syntax highlighting and equations. Yes, there are WordPress
  plugins to handle both of these things, but each seem to have their
  own non-standard syntax making it difficult to switch between
  different engines. Furthermore, the themeing of WordPress makes it
  harder than it should be to style code blocks without having to muck
  around with the CSS for the rest of the site. While Blogs@VT is
  excellent at responding to plugin-install requests, there is still a
  non-zero turn around time, making it difficult to try a number of
  solutions before settling on a final one.

- lack of versioning/backup. I was at the mercy of blogs@vt as far as
  backups were concerned, and versioning control is pretty dismal with
  the WordPress interface.


## Hello Nanoc ##

[Nanoc](http://nanoc.ws) is one of roughly
[32 bazillion static site generators](https://iwantmyname.com/blog/2011/02/list-static-website-generators.html). A
static site generator works a lot like the software behind a dynamic
site, like WordPress, but instead of doing the transformation of data
to HTML pages on the fly on the server, all the work is done locally
on your own machine. What gets sent to the server is a set of HTML and
CSS files that make up a complete site.

Nanoc happens to be written in [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/), a
language I am not terribly familiar with, but want to learn, one
reasons I choose Nanoc over some of the other options. Jekyll is
another popular Ruby-based static-site generator. It seems to be
primarily aimed at generating blog sites, and is very good at what it
does. While this is certainly a blog, I am also interest in creating
less blog-specific websites, and so the more general-site approach
used by Nanoc (but with some handy dandy
[blogging helper modules](http://nanoc.ws/docs/api/Nanoc/Helpers/Blogging.html))
was more appealing for my long term goals.

## Static is Better (for me)##

I can use the same work-flow I use for most other text files. I create
content mostly in Markdown using Emacs. This makes it super easy to
include things like source code blocks and equations, things that were
always a bit tricky in WordPress. Since everything is stored as text
files I can use [git](http://git-scm.com) for version control and because the generated
content is just a bunch of static files I can use the awesomely free
[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/) to host my site.

I have more control. There are a ton of decent themes for WordPress,
but tweaking to get things the way you want can be a pain. The
stylesheets tend to be big and complex, and finding just the right
place to change can be difficult when you don't know what you're
looking for and there seem to be 10 times the necessary structural
elements.

## Static has Challenges ##

As I mentioned, *most* content on a blog is static, and so it makes
sense to serve it up as static pages. As with all things in life,
there are some exceptions, notably commenting systems. The real-time
comments you see on WordPress and the like are dynamic features and
implementing these with a static site generator can be a challenge. I
had originally planned on going with a popular 3rd party service
Disqus, but after reading
[a strong argument](http://www.jeremyscheff.com/2011/08/jekyll-and-other-static-site-generators-are-currently-harmful-to-the-free-open-source-software-movement/)
against Disqus on grounds of it not being open source I wavered. I'm
not sure how much of an open source fundamentalist I want to be
yet. Generally I'd like to adopt a more pragmatic philosophy and use
non-free-as-in-speech software if it gets the job done better than
free alternatives. But comments are a little special, because there's
the other issue of data privacy. Of course, the comments themselves
will be made public, but there are other pieces of data associated
with a comment, such as email and IP addresses, that would warrant a
good read of Disqus's (or whatever other social commenting service I'd
consider)
[privacy policy](http://help.disqus.com/customer/portal/articles/466259-privacy-policy)
before jumping in head first.

It turns out that there *is* an open-source alternative called
[juvia](https://github.com/phusion/juvia). I haven't taken too much of
a look at it but it seems to have all the important bits in
place. Since it is just the code, I'd have to set up my own server to
run the service itself, so integrating the comments with my static
blog would be similar to the process with Disqus and make use of some
JavaScript magic.

The simplicity of a
[static commenting solution](http://tlvince.com/static-commenting) has
its draw. It seems the most elegant approach, if I can just get a good
workflow. Matt Palmer
[has developed](http://hezmatt.org/~mpalmer/blog/2011/07/19/static-comments-in-jekyll.html)
[a plugin](http://theshed.hezmatt.org/jekyll-static-comments/) for
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to handle static comments,
I suspect it could be easily modified to work with nanoc.

## Trackbacks vs. Referrals

[Trackbacks and Pingbacks](http://webtrainingwheels.com/what-are-pingbacks-and-trackbacks-and-how-do-i-use-them/)
are protocols to help connect blog posts that refer to each other. The
rely on special software running on a server responding in real-time
to requests and as such are dynamic features. I have not read up
enough on either protocol to determine how or if I want to implement in
on this site. I did come across [a relatively old post](http://daringfireball.net/2003/06/take_your_trackbacks_and_dangle.htmlq) making the
argument that given the majority use of Trackback it is unnecessary and
duplicates the functionality already gained by referrals. There is of
course [a rebuttal](http://www.onfocus.com/2003/06/32182), so I am still not sure what to do. One way or
another, it would be nice to generate a list of posts/pages/resources
that link back to individual articles here.
