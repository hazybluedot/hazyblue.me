In affecting how we interact with information, technology shapes the
way we think. This is one of the insights McLuhan makes in "The Medium
is the Message", the first chapter of "Understanding Media: The
Extension of Man". As educators, we must always be aware of this fact:
the way in which we present content will affect the way learners
interact with the material. This will be the case regardless of
whether or not we are aware of it.

Using digital technology in the classroom naively may restrict
thinking and hinder learning, but making use of the digital mediums
strengths can lead to truly innovative ways of interacting with
learning material.

It is difficult to imagine what the future may hold with our vantage
point firmly rooted in the present. Technology continues to evolve
around us, but we often forget that we have gone through medium
revolutions in the past and many aspects of media use we now take for
granted were once innovations.

## From Gutenberg to McLuhan

Do you know how to use a book? How do you know how to use a book?

Gutenberg first developed his printing press
[around 1436](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing_Press#Gutenberg.27s_press),
and it was in widespread use by 1440. However, books, as we would
recognize them, didn't take shape until
[after 1501](http://www.designhistory.org/BookHistory_pages/Incunabula.html). Features
obvious to us: page numbers, title pages, table of contents, indexes,
and footnotes were all inventions with their own set of
conventions. Put yourself in the head of a 15th century reader, if you
came across a superscript digit would you know to look to the bottom
of the page, or end of the chapter (what the heck is a "chapter"?) to
find the corresponding note?

## From Le Prince to Welles

An entirely new medium came into existence with the invention of the
motion picture camera by Louis Le Prince in 1888.  It should come as
no surprise that the earliest motion pictures were little more than
plays recorded to film. Talkies quickly replaced silent films in the
1920s, but film of the era was still at its infancy as directors were
learning the new flexibility of the medium. It was Orson Welles first
feature film, Citizen Kane, that marks the new era of film based
expression. Citizen Kane made
[innovations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_Kane#Filmmaking_innovations)
in nearly every aspect of film production:

cinematography
: the use of deep-focus and low-angle shots

storytelling
: the entire story is told in a series of flashbacks and multiple
narrators

special effects
: the use of camera tricks to create the effect of crowds and interior
spaces larger than they were in reality

makeup
: Welles played both the young, hansom Kane as well as old, wrinkled Kane

soundtrack
: sounds added richness and depth to the visual scenes. The use of the
L-cut, in which the audio of the next scene starts before the video
switches eased the transition of scene to scene, making it seem more
natural and less jarring than a cut in which audio and video
transitioned in unison.

music
: the use of musical cues to suggest or aid in the interpretation of
the action happening on the screen.

When asked how he, as a fledgling director, found the confidence to
make such unconventional use of the medium, Welles responded with

> ignorance ... sheer ignorance. There is no confidence to equal
> it. It's only when you know something about a profession that you
> are timid or careful.

It took over 50 years after the invention of the printing press, the
enabling technology behind the mass production of books, before modern
conventions that we are familiar with were in place.  It was over 40
years after the invention of film before "Citizen Kane" usured in the
era of "modern" films.  While digital computers have been around since
the 1940s, I would argue that until the proliferation of personal
computers in the 1980s there was little use of computers outside of
their number crunching forte. The personal computer, and exponetial
improvements in display technology opened the door for experimentation
with general purpose information representation. Dramatically new
possibilities were created with the rise of the Internet finally The
world wide web which has been in existence only for a bit over two
decades.

It is safe to say that we are still in the infancy period of digital
media. This is a very exciting time, as we (you!) will play a role in
defining the new conventions and techniques of exploring the digital
landscape that one day will be as ubiquitous as footnotes and
chapters. It is also a frustrating time, as the tools available to us
are not yet mature, and still have strong ties to earlier modes of
thinking making it difficult to fully realize our imagination and take
advantage of all the medium has to offer.

## The Four Essential Properties of Digital Environments

In "Hamlet on the Holodeck" (1997), Janet Murray describes four
properties of digital environments that set the medium apart in its
ability to convey a message. She says digital environments are:

procedural
: the ability to execute a sequence of commands

participatory
: the ability to respond to user input

spatial
: the ability to simulate information in a spatial
  environment in which a user can navigate

encyclopedic
: the ability to quickly search through and access
  truly massive amounts of data

<aside> <h1>Augmenting Human Intellect</h1> <p> The four properties of
digital environments complement nicely with the human brain's natural
strengths and weaknesses. In particular, evolution has shaped a brain
predisposed to thinking spatially: think of the navigation skills
needed for effective hunting and gathering. It is natural to use our
innate spatial thinking when exploring digital environments.
Likewise, cost-of-retrieval vs. relevance trade off in our memory
retrieval abilities favors recent information over old and repeated
information over infrequent. Our memory retrieval system is *not*
encyclopedic so it behooves us to offload data storage and retrieval
to a computer.</p> </aside>

Think of your own experiences with technology in the classroom as a
student? How often any of these properties exploited?

Is something like a common slide-based presentation made with any of
the commonly available tools really taking advantage of these
properties any more than could be achieved with overhead
transparencies?

Given the currently available tools it is quite easy to prepare
content in a digital medium mirroring traditional print media. It is
much harder to be truly innovative, both due to lack of effective
tools, and the psychology of breaking free of current assumptions and
conventions.

This isn't to say innovation is impossible, far from it. But it may
take some conscious effort, or as realized by Orson Welles, ignorance
of traditional practices, to achieve something great.

A tool like [Prezi](http://www.prezi.com) is a reasonable start
(though for more control, flexibility and freedom with an albeit less
polished interface check out the
[Sozi](http://sozi.baierouge.fr/wiki/en:welcome) plugin for
[Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org)).  It makes it relatively easy to
create a
[rich, spatial and explorable environment](http://prezi.com/o431nwmfyrh7/present/?auth_key=94q61um&follow=xfaykqnsr566&kw=present-o431nwmfyrh7&rc=ref-4993629)
of information which viewers can navigate through in a free-form
fashion. On the other hand, it is still lacking some key features
found in other digital media technology, such as hyperlinks. I would
really like the ability to link different areas of a presentation to
others, or to content outside of the presentation environment.

The game [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net/) is a good example of
leveraging all four properties of digital environments.  In the game,
players build structures in a virtual environment that they and other
players can move through.  To get some idea of the extent of the
encyclopedic and spatial content contained in the Minecraft
environment click on over to
[The Scale of the Universe](http://htwins.net/scale2/) and move the
slider to the right until you can see the planets Neptune and Uranus.

Fun and games are fine, but where's the learning? The user Salaja
[built a working CPU](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/109385-Computer-Built-in-Minecraft-Has-RAM-Performs-Division)
 in the game demonstrating the potential educational
power in such an open-ended digital environment.

## Feign Ignorance and Innovate

Remember, we are still in the early exploratory phase of digital
media. Don't allow yourself to be trapped by conventions created by
the restrictions of other media representations.  Keep in mind that
how content is structured and displayed will affect how learners think
about the ideas conveyed. Use this to your advantage! When presenting
a collection of ideas that are connected, but not in a linear fashion,
don't impose linearity if you can help it! Play into our natural
ability to explore spatial environments and retain spatial
relationships between objects. Recognize our limitations when it comes
to retrieving arbitrary bits of information and let the computer do
that work for the learner.

Understand that mistakes will be made. Not all innovative uses of
technology will be necessarily good. When trying something new, be
open with the learners so that they know what to (and not to) expect,
and solicit feedback! A digital representation of an idea space that
may seem intuitive to you may be confusing to new learners (don't
confuse true intuition with familiarity).

Have you come across any innovative uses of digital media to convey
ideas that utilized a combination of some or all of the four
properties of digital environments? Share them in the comments!
