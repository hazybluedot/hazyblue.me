What does a seventy year old residential college at a prestigious
university have to do with a forty year old operating system? Perhaps
more than one might think. While reading blog posts on the
[ECE2524 mother blog](http://ece2524.ece.vt.edu/) I came across
[an entry](https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/bishwa9/2013/09/29/hrcs-blog-1-my-thoughts-on-the-collegiate-way-of-living-the-book-and-the-current-system/)
posted for another class altogether.

The reading, [A Collegiate Way of Living](http://collegiateway.org/news/2008-collegiate-way-of-living), by Mark B. Ryan, referenced
by the superficially off topic blog post, sound interesting and so I
found a copy and read the forward by Richard Brodhead in which I came
across this:

> colleges have continued to give undergraduates a pleasant, elegant
> place in which to live, eat, and associate. As their founders must

Flexibility. Adaptability.  Through thoughtful design of the
environment and (perhaps) conscious lack of specification regarding
*how* the environment should be used.  These sound like familiar
ideas.

I find it incredibly interesting that it seems there is a strong
correlation between the idea of designing an open environment and the
longevity, flexibility and adaptability of a system, whether it be the
social system of a residential college, or a computer operating
system. Of course, an OS that isn't used by humans isn't a very
successful OS, so there is the social component of Unix as well, and
more so than other operating systems given that it was developed with
creating a strong community of people in mind:

It's worth noting that this transition to typing programs into a
terminal marked a rather large shift in the way programmers interacted
with computers (and in turn, one another). By typing directly into a
terminal, and seeing the results of programs immediately the
relationship between programmer and computer became much more like an
interactive conversation than was possible with punch
cards. Programmers were in closer communication with the computers
they were programming, while at the same time the programmers were
making a conscious effort to be in closer communication with each
other.

Least we forget, these are certainly not the only two examples of
design-the-environment-but-not-the-application success stories.

And what, after all, is the primary result of living in a residential
college other than encouraging close communication with other
scholars? Our thoughts are data packets, being passed from one network
node to the next, and out of that, something incredible can form.
Something that is larger than the sum of its parts, and something new
that was never explicitly planned for in the original design.

Contrast this with how an engineering curriculum is designed. It
usually involves a certain number of credits, from specific groups of
courses, often times specifying what should be learned, and when. It
seems to me, if what we want is to develop a community of engineers
who are able to adapt and solve a growing array of new problems then
we're going about it all wrong.

What would a curriculum look like if the design focus was on creating
an environment rather than specifying the heck out of course work?
What would evaluation look like? And, since 'tis the season, what
would accreditation look like?

Perhaps we should just try it and find out.
