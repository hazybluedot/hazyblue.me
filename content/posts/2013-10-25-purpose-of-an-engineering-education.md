What role does a university have in society? What should an education
aim to bestow on its recipient? Do we have different expectations of
an engineering education?

In a recent conversation I was arguing for an emphasis on knowledge of
process over specific tool training. This particular conversation was
with someone in an accounting or business field, but I have had
similar exchanges with other engineers. I often wonder how idealized
my own feelings are and if my views are somewhat disconnected from the
reality of the world... and if I should consider that a problem with
me, or the world.

The specific topic was Excel vs. spreadsheets. I feel the tendency is
for companies to say things like "should know how to use Excel" and
then that gets translated into teaching students Excel in the
university. But is the role of an education to teach a proprietary
software tool, or the concepts and ways of thinking that and other
tools like it are based on?  Rather than teaching Excel, shouldn't we
be teaching statistics and how to manipulate lists and tables of
numerical data? If faced with a future version of Excel 2015 a
graduate discovers that the `MEAN()` function has disappeared, would we
rather them freak out and demand their company roll back to a previous
version, or should we instead strive to empower and educate them so
that if faced with such a scenario they calmly implement their own
function and carry on without so much as a hiccup?

Replace 'Excel' and 'spreadsheet' with 'MATLAB' and 'linear algebra'
for a similar thought experiment applicable to engineering. And feel
free to expand/generalize as need be for any other discipline.

I don't claim that we should actively prevent students from learning
commercial and/or proprietary software but I remain extremely weary of
the impact on the curriculum when demands from industry like "must
know Excel/MATLAB" are implemented.

Which brings me to my more fundamental struggle. What is the role of a
university education? Are we preparing future citizens of the world,
or are we training future employees for roles in a capitalism driven
economy? It seems like we have some responsibility to do both, but are
the two goals compatible? Or should we worry when one takes over in
influence?
