In
[a recent post](http://markus-kusano.github.io/blog/2014/01/03/cheating/),
[Markus](http://markus-kusano.github.io) mused if too much help for a
colleague could be a bad thing.

Failure is certainly a valuable learning experience and I think one
thing we need to do that will benefit everyone is remove the stigma of
failure, and where appropriate, reduce the risk.  I suspect that many
of the honor code violations that occur are a result of the fear of
failure. We would rather risk the chance of getting caught cheating
than turn in work that we suspect would result in a low grade.

Part of the problem is that it can be very difficult to recover from a
low grade if there aren't clear pathways to do so. This increases the
risk of failure and raises the incentive to get a high grade the first
time by any means necessary.

I try to think of ways to make failure cheaper by making it
recoverable, usually with some kind of make-up policy, or in the case
of many programming assignments, automatically testing behavior and
allowing unlimited submissions before the due date. I may make
some tweaks to the system I used last semester, in particular, I like
[Jean-Philippe](https://github.com/jpouellet)'s suggestion of
penalizing subsequent broken compiles to encourage learners to compile
and read error messages locally instead of depending on the grading
system for that step.

## Giving and Receiving Help

My idea of a perfect learning environment is one that encourages
learners to help one another. There is always the possibility that
those seeking help are looking for answers, rather than understanding,
but I don't think it's worth anyone's time to try and over-structure
how and when help should be provided.  There are ways a helper can
help that encourage learning without simply "giving the answer".  Some
techniques that I've used that seem to work are

1. Ask the learner to describe in their own words the problem as best
   they can, including any possible solutions that come to
   mind. Sometime just the act of putting the thoughts into words
   organizes thoughts in such a way that allow the learner to discover
   a path to the solution.
2. When prompting is needed, ask questions rather than give answers.
   - Does this problem remind you of any you've faced in the past?
   - What have you tried? Did any of them seem to work "more" than others?
   - Can you break this problem up into two smaller ones that are easier to solve?

3. Let the learner drive. For computer based work never take control
   of the learner's keyboard. Describe what they should be doing and
   let them do the typing/clicking.  To a large extent I think this
   can be applied to non-computer work as well, but I haven't had as
   much opportunity to test it in practice.
4. Describe how you would approach the problem yourself, how would you
   break it into pieces, and how much you tackle each piece.
5. If you do need to show a learner how to do something, use an
   example different from the one causing the confusion with a
   solution that follows the same patter. Describe the approach you're
   taking and how it can be applied to the problem on hand.

## Role of the Instructor

Ideally, instructors shouldn't have to spend too much time worrying
about how to catch cheaters, but rather how best to engage learners
with the material. A university's honor code can help take some of the
burden off of instructors so they don't have to act like plagiarism
police. In The Last Lecture, Randy Pausch writes

At Virginia Tech [the honor code](http://www.honorsystem.vt.edu/)
allows a similar freedom. In fact, it is recommended that the
instructor not directly confront a student with a suspected violation,
but instead grade and return the assignment assuming there is no honor
violation and submit submit a Violation Report Form to the Honor
System.

## Cheatless Assignments

In some cases it isn't hard to come up with "uncheatable"
assignments, though I tend to feel that the focus should not be
on "cheatability" when creating an assignment, but rather how the
assignment is intended to change the learner's engagement with
the material.  For instance, the first assignment of ECE2524 has
always been a short essay or similar written assignment.
Originally it was something like 

> Read the first chapter of the book.  Write a short essay describing
> the relationship between Linux, Unix and GNU. Who were the people
> involved in each project and what were their motives for their
> work?

It's a fairly straight forward research essay. Easy to grade with
a simple rubric (did they mention GNU/Richard Stallman? did
they mention Linux/Linus Torvalds?, etc.), but rather boring
to read when you have 50-60 to get through. And also, relatively
easy to plagiarize.

This past semester I changed the assignment to 

> Read the first chapter of the book. Pick two nuggets that jump out
> at you and blog about them. These could either be things that spark
> your interest, or that you donâ€™t quite understand. Be sure to
> include a cited quote for each nugget. How do you hope to explore
> these interests in this class?

My primary motivations for the change were to make the assignment
more interesting for me to read, and more interesting for
learners.  It helps me get a sense of where people's interests
lie, how familiar they are with the material, and what their
expectations are for the class.  All in all, much more useful to
me, and I think to the learner as well, than the original
assignment.  As a side effect, it's hard to plagiarize the answer
to "what interests you?" and doesn't really make sense to try.
