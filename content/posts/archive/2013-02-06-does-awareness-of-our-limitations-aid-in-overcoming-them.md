A couple of thoughts have been bouncing around in my head while
reading. First, while reading
_[As We May Think](http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/)_ by
Bush, but repeatedly with other sources, I was reminded of a thought I
often have when reading science ficture written in the 50s, around the
same time Vannevar Bush wrote _As We May Think_. While on many levels
the predictions of the future turned out to be quite accurate, there
are notable exceptions that jump out at me while reading. A really
good example that illustrates my point is Isaac Asimov's Foundation
series. The series is somewhat unique in that it covers a huge expanse
of time in the fictional world, over 20,000 years if all the short
stories and novels written by other authors after Asimov's death are
taken into account, and was written over several decades in standard
non-fictional Earth time: the four stories that made up the first
published book in the series were written between 1942
and 1944. Asimov thought he was done with the series after writing two
stories in 1948 and 1949 and went on to do other things for 30
years. After much continued pressure from fans and friends he
published the 6th book in the series in 1982 and the 7th
in 1986.

Three things struck me while reading the first part of the series,
written in the 40s and 50s:

- It was generally assumed that nuclear power was the energy of the
  future. The logical extrapolation was nuclear powered wrist-watches
  (ok, actually, I did read a compelling article fairly recently
  revisiting micro-atomic generators using minuscule amounts of
  radioactive materials to agitate a pizo-electric element to produce
  electricity, so maybe this wasn't so far off the mark)
- While we would have space ships capable of faster-than-light travel
  (hyperspace!), the calculations to perform jumps and ensure that the
  trajectory didn't travel too near the gravitational effects of a
  star were done by a human, by hand. Particularly long jumps took the
  better part of a day to calculate and verify before it was deemed
  safe to tell the ship to execute the maneuver which itself would
  only take a fraction of a second.
- There were no women whatsoever in any type of leadership role. We
  could say the same of ethnic minorities, non-heterosexual and
  non-cisgendered people as well, but we will give Asimov the benefit
  of the doubt and acknowledge that the U.S. was (at least visibly)
  much less diverse than it is today. But surely he knew about the
  existence of women.

These are little things you get used to when reading science fiction
of the time. I think perhaps most interesting is that while it is
common to extrapolate technology into the future with reasonably
accuracy, the social structures that will exist 10,000 years from now
are remarkably similar to those of the current time, if science
fiction authors have anything to say about it.

As I mentioned, the 6th book, Foundation's Edge was published
in 1982. Within the first page or so it was revealed without fanfare
that the mayor of Terminus, politically the (quasi) central planet of
The Foundation (despite it being on the outskirts of the colonized
worlds), is currently a woman. Also, due to much research and
development the latest spaceships have a new feature: hyperjumps are
calculated in a matter of seconds by on-board computers. Also the old
nuclear technology has been replaced by state-of-the-art
zero-point-energy extraction (if I recall correctly, it's been a while
since I read the books!) providing a nearly unexhaustable energy
source to power your jaunts around the universe.

The changes, while artfully worked into the narrative and coherently
worked into the fictional universe that had first been described over
30 years prior, still jumped out at the casual reader. I bring this up
by no means to diminish Asimov's work, or him personally (I'm a huge
fan, having read and enjoyed just about every book he's written at
this point), but rather to suggest that we has a species have some
fundamental limitations in regards to predicting the future. We view
the future through a lens designed by history and crafted in the
present. While it is all too natural for us to extrapolate existing
technology and social dynamics arbitrarily far into the future, and
while that leads to some really fascinating scenarios, making
significant conceptual leaps (such as the one Ada Lovelace is
attributed to making) is something much more difficult and happens
much less frequently.

What I wonder though, is after a long history of learning from our
shortsightedness in some instances (and acknowledging our
forsightedness in others), can we overcome this limitation? Are we
now, compared to the 1950s, better able to make conceptual leaps and
imagine technology and social structures that are fundamentally
different from those of the present simply because we are aware that
we tend to make certain kinds of assumptions? Why would a woman even
WANT to be mayor of a politically powerful planet?
