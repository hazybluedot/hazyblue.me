...but it also is perfectly relevant to the discussion we had in PFP about teaching evaluations: [http://www.theonion.com/articles/professor-deeply-hurt-by-students-evaluation,20130/](http://www.theonion.com/articles/professor-deeply-hurt-by-students-evaluation,20130/) and the last "quote" is especially relevant to the discussion in GEDI about teaching responsibilities:

> “Students and the enormous revenue they bring in to our institution are a more valued commodity to us than faculty,” Dean James Hewitt said. “Although Rothberg is a distinguished, tenured professor with countless academic credentials and knowledge of 21 modern and ancient languages, there is absolutely no excuse for his boring Chad with his lectures. Chad must be entertained at all costs.”  
 Do you think there's some truth to that?
