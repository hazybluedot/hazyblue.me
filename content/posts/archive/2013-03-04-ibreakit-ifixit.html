This past weekend ended up being the weekend of repairs as two lingering problems increased to a point that they could no longer be ignored:

  1. The drain pipe of my bathroom sink completely detached itself from the sink basin.
  2. The aluminum frame on the display of my laptop began peeling away from the LCD panel to such an extend that I was concerned continued use could result in cracking the front glass.

  1. The computer to be repaired
  2. mini screwdriver set
  3. Donut, preferably coconut
  4. Coffee
  5. working computer that can access [ifixit.com](http://ifixit.com)
  6. 5 minute epoxy
  7. T6 Torex screwdriver
  8. A reasonably heavy, flat object
  9. Stress relief

  1. Follow the steps in the ifixit guide to remove the display assembly from the body of the laptop.
  2. Reset donut
  3. attempt to apply epoxy in gap between aluminum backing and display, apply pressure, wait for a couple hours
  4. reassemble laptop, power on and use
  5. determine that epoxy is not holding, either due to age, bad application due to limited access to the surface
  6. powerdown and re-disassemble laptop
  7. Using a heat gun to loosen the remaining adhesive around the display casing, gently pry off the aluminum backing completely
  8. This is a perfect opportunity to "pimp your mac" and add some sort of creative graphic behind the apple logo. All I could find was some engineering paper, which turned out somewhat ho-hum.
  9. attempt to remove old adhesive with acetone and/or mechanical force. give up.
  10. Working quickly, (it is 5 minute epoxy, after all) mix up a fresh batch of epoxy, apply intelligently around edge of display casing, choosing places that look least likely to cause problems if it runs over (e.g. avoid iSight camera housing)
  11. Carefully position aluminum backing back on display casing, press firmly and wipe away excess epoxy.
  12. Apply gentle pressure for 5-10 minutes, let cure for another hour or so before reassembly.

  13. Re-assemble.
  14. success!

----------

 take a genius to determine that a different bootloader from Apple's default is not a virus.

too late

aside from possibly rendering my display useless

 if you have ever replaced a tire on your car, but freak out at the idea of fixing your own computer, briefly consider the consequences of a botched repair job on both. Statistically you are much more likely to die in a horrible, fiery crash as the result of a bad tire replacement than a botched attempt at re-gluing your laptop screen together. Just something to think about.

wordpress fail: I could not figure out how to tell wordpress to use letters to "number" this ordered list without changing the style sheet for my theme. It could be user error, but I prefer to blame wordpress.
