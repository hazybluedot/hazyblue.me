The interwebz have been all atwitter the past month or so with
[Valve's announcement](http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2013/02/steam-linux/)
of the porting of their Steam gaming service to the GNU/Linux
platform. Many Linux users were thrilled about the announcement and
saw it as a sign that Linux was breaking out of the small niche
culture of hackers to more mainstream folk who just want to turn there
computer on and play a game. To be fair, Linux is not without a large
number of free (both as in
[beer and as in speech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratis_versus_libre))
[games already](https://libregamewiki.org/Main_Page), but the
announcement of a major (are they? I actually only heard of Valve and
Steam because of the Linux announcement) gaming company moving to the
platform as seen by some as legitimizing the OS to the masses. It
certainly gives everyone something to talk about.

I consider myself more of a pragmatic when it comes to the
philosophical debate surrounding free (for those familiar, the debate
mostly deals with libre software. English has many deficiencies, one
of which is the multiple meanings of the word "free". In general free
software supporters do support the idea of paying for software and
believe that people should be able to make money off of the software
they write). I think free software is a great ideal to strive for, and
certainly for mission critical software I believe it is important to
have the freedom to view and modify the source code. As I brought up
in [vtcli](http://gardnercampbell.wetpaint.com/page/vtclis13) earlier
this semester, as an example it is important to have the freedom to
confirm that the incognito mode of your web browser really is doing
what it says it is and not storing or sharing your browsing
information (as an aside to that, I erroneously claimed that Chrome
was open source, it is not, however, it theoretically uses the same
code-base as [Chromium](http://www.chromium.org/), which is open
source, and happens to be the browser I use both when in Linux and OS
X. I highly encourage any users of Chrome to switch to Chromium for
the open sourced goodness it provides, including the ability to
confirm that incognito mode really is incognito). That being said, if
there's a great game I like I am not terribly concerned with not being
able to look at or distribute the source code, though I certainly
would encourage game developers to release their code under one of the
many open source licenses.

It is interesting to note that free software evangelist Richard
Stallman himself
[isn't ALL doom and gloom](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/nonfree-games.html)
about the news. Though he certainly isn't thrilled and encourages
people to try out any of the free games that are available, he does
see the move as a possible motivator for some people to ditch their
non-free OSes completely if gaming had been the only thing holding
them back.

I installed Steam on my [Arch Linux](https://www.archlinux.org/)
install last week and so far have tried out
[Bastion](http://store.steampowered.com/app/107100/),
[Splice](http://store.steampowered.com/app/209790/) and
[The World of Goo](http://store.steampowered.com/app/22000/). All work
very well and have been fun (I had played World of Goo before both on
OS X and Android, it is fun on any platform!). Offically, Arch Linux
isn't supported but after adding a couple of the libraries and font
packages
[mentioned on the wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Steam)
everything worked like a charm. One down side that Stallman failed to
mention in his response was the fact that it is much easier for me to
spend money on games now that I don't need to switch over to OS X to
run them.
