In his article [The internet: Everything you ever need to know](http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/jun/20/internet-everything-need-to-know), John Naughton lists nine key concepts about the Internet to help us understand that profound impact it is having, and will continue to have, on our lives.  Reading number 3 "DISRUPTION IS A FEATURE, NOT A BUG" I found myself drawing parallels to the design of the Internet and the design of the Unix operating system. The similarities are no accident, as the history of Unix and the Internet became closely intertwined after DARPA's 1980 decisions that the BSD Unix team would implement the brand new TCP/IP stack which controls how data packets are routed between machines on the Internet.  Of the design of the Internet, Naughton says > The result of this was a general purpose network from which sprang a diverse collection of services and applications (including the World Wide Web, see item number 2), some of which began disrupting established industries. This disruption, Naughton argues, is a desirable effect, though not necessarily to the  existing music labels and media distributor behemoths such Warner Music Group and others that are having to drastically rethink their business models to remain relevant in the era of peer-to-peer data networks. Like the Internet, Unix was designed around a number of axioms, the relevant ones being that the system should provide a core set of well defined, simple system calls for interacting with hardware and data, and that passing data between processes should be as easy as possible.  As a result of these design choices an environment of diverse programs, each of which "do one thing and one thing well" and can easily share data with other programs has developed.  The end result of this can be thought of as a direct contrast to this description by Eric Raymond in his book [The Art of Unix Programming](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s05.html): > Unix users, on the other hand, have consistently been able to complete tasks that were never anticipated by the original designers, a key factor in its continued relevance.  As technology changes and users demand new tools and applications developers on other systems have to work a lot harder and are at the mercy of the system developers to make changes to the underlying system to continue to produce cutting edge software solutions.  On a Unix system it is just as easy to copy a file from your USB  flash drive to your hard drive as it is to copy a file from your harddrive to a machine on the other side of the world and it is just as easy to stream video data from a local file as it is from a server on the internet.  The design has lead to a remarkable, even surprising degree of flexibility and usefulness:

> Unix has supported a mind-bogglingly wide spectrum of uses. No other operating system has shone simultaneously as a research vehicle, a friendly host for technical custom applications, a platform for commercial-off-the-shelf business software, and a vital component technology of the Internet. - Eric Raymond, The Art of Unix Programming
 Like the Internet, the simple infrastructure layer by Unix (and its present-day incarnations such as BSD and GNU/Linux) provides an environment for nearly unlimited creativity, one which continues to surprise users and non-users alike with its ability to solve problems and implement ideas that a year ago didn't even exist.  And likewise, the disruption it has caused has been a boon to individuals: The Linux based Android operating system is running on [over half the world's smart phones](http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/2237315) and [quickly overtoke](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_operating_system#Market_share) more established contenders such as Apple's iOS.  Linux has already disrupted the [server market, the embedded market and most recently the phone market](http://softwareandunicycles.wordpress.com/2010/07/31/does-desktop-linux-need-a-killer-app/).  It remains to be seen whether or not it will have a noticeable impact on Microsoft's stranglehold on the desktop market, unless you consider Apple's Unix derived OS X as an example. the end.
