A number of recent conversations, combined with topics-of-interest in
both [ECE2524](https://blogs.lt.vt.edu/ece2524s13) and
[VTCLI](http://gardnercampbell.wetpaint.com/page/vtclis13), followed
by a chance encounter with an unfamiliar (to me) blogger's
[post](http://craphound.com/?p=2171:ta) have all led me to believe I
should write a bit about interface design and various tools available
to aid in writing workflow.No matter our field, I'm willing to bet we
all do some writing. Our writing workflow has undergone some changes
since transitioning to the digital era, most notably for my interests
is this quote from the
[aforementioned blog post](http://craphound.com/?p=2171:ta):

> â€¦prior to the computerized era, writers produced a series complete
> drafts on the way to publications, complete with erasures,
> annotations, and so on. These are archival gold, since they
> illuminate the creative process in a way that often reveals the
> hidden stories behind the books we care about.

The author then introduces a
[set of scripts](http://bitbucketlabs.net/flashbake/) a colleague
wrote as the response to a question on how to integrate version
control into his writing process. The scripts are essentially a
wrapper around [git](http://git-scm.com/video/what-is-git), a popular
version control system used by software developers and originally
designed to meet the needs of a massively distributed collaborative
projects, namely [the Linux kernel](http://www.kernel.org/).

What's really great about this (aside from the clear awesomeness of a
sci-fi author collaborating with a
[techie blogger/podcaster](http://thecommandline.net/) to create a
tool that is useful and usable by writers using tools that that are
useful and usable by software developers) is that it brings into clear
focus some thoughts I wanted to get out last semester about the
benefits of writing in a plain text format.

This gets back to one of the recent conversations that also ties into
all of this: I was talking to a friend of mine, another grad student
in a STEM field, and we were discussing the unfortunate prevalence of
the use of MS Word for scientific papers. I don't want to get into a
long discussion of the demerits of MS Word in general, but suffice it
to say, if you are interested in producing a professional quality
paper, and enjoy the experience of shooting yourself in both feet
before running a marathon, then by all means, use MS Word. There
are also a number of excuses of questionable validity that people use
to defend their MS Word usage in scientific writing. The ones that are
often brought up often involve the need to collaborate with other
authors who are also using MS Word.

Now run that marathon backwards while juggling flaming torches.

I should point out I don't want to just pick on MS Word here, the same
goes for Apple's Pages or any large software package that tries to be
the solution to all your writing needs. I will hence forth refer to
this problematic piece of software generically as a "Word Processor",
capitalized to reinforce the idea that I am indeed referring to a
number of specific widely used tools.

The conversation led to user interfaces, and the alleged intuitiveness
of a modern Word Processor, compared to simple, yet powerful text
editor such as [emac](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)s or
[vim](http://www.vim.org/index.php). Out of that, my friend discovered
a post on a neuroscience blog about
[user friendly user interfaces](http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/neuroscience-of-user-friendly/)
that did a nice job putting into writing thoughts that I had been
trying to verbalize during our discussion. Namely that the supposed
intuitiveness of a Word Processor to "new" users is largely a factor
of familiarity rather than any innate intuitiveness to the
interface. Once your learn what the symbols mean and where the
numerous menu items are that you need to access then it all seems just
dandy. Until they go and
[change the interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Microsoft_Word)
on you.

I could and probably should write an entire post on ALL the benefits
of adopting a plain-text workflow, and the benefits of using one text
editor that you know well for all your writing needs, from scientific
papers, to blog, presentations and emails (how many people ever stop
to think why it is acceptable and normal to have to learn a new user
interface for each different writing task, even though fundamentally
the actual work is all the same?). The key benefit I want to highlight
here is the one that made it possible for the collaborative effort I
mentioned towards the top to take place. By writing in a plain text
format, you immediately have the ability to use the enormous wealth of
tools that have been developed throughout the history of computing
that work with plain text. If our earlier mentioned hero had been
doing his writing in a Word Processor, it would have been nearly
impossible for his friend to piece together a tool for him that allows
him to regain something that was lost with the transition away from a
paper workflow, a tool that can "illuminate the creative process in a
way that often reveals the hidden stories", and in many ways goes
beyond what was possible or convenient with the paper workflow.

What tools do you use to track your writing process?  Do they allow
you to go back to any earlier revision, or allow you to easily
discover what recent blog's you had read, what your mood and what the
weather was when you wrote a particular passage? Do you use a tool
with an interface that is a constant distraction, or one that is
hardly noticeable and lets you focus on what actually matters: the
words on the page. If not, then why?
