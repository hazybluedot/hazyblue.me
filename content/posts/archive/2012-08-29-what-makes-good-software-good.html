The first day of class (ECE2524: Introduction to Unix for Engineers) I asked participents the  open ended question "What makes good software good?" and asked them to answer both "for the developer" and "for the consumer". I generated a list of words and phrases for each sub-response and then normalized it based on my own intuition (e.g. I changed "simplicity" to "simple", "easy to use" to "intuitive", etc.). I then dumped the list into [Wordle](http://www.wordle.net/) to generate these images: **Good Software for the Consumer****Good Software for the Developer** For a future in-class exercise I plan to ask participants to link the common themes that appear in these word clouds back to specific rules mentioned in [the reading](http://catb.org/esr/writings/taoup/html/ch01s06.html).
