This is a picture of me wearing a hat I made:

![a "Scott Pilgrim" hat I made](/images/meinhat-300x225.jpg)

It was made from the same pattern used to make the hat used in the
movie Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The woman who did the work
of adapting the hat drawn in the comic to something that could be
made for a movie made her pattern available (for a small fee) on
[ravelry.com](www.ravelry.com), a social network for knitters and
crocheters. I'm writing this post right after finishing a dinner which
included mushroom leek risotto which I made while reading (risotto the
real way involves a lot of stirring and pouring in broth a little at a
time) *Bringing it to the Table* by Wendell Berry. The book is a
collection of essays Berry wrote over several decades on the topic of
farming and food (Not entirely incidentally, Wendell Berry
[caused a stir](https://www.google.com/search?q=wendell+berry+%22why+I+am+not+going+to+buy+a+computer%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&client=firefox-a&channel=fflb)
and inadvertently started a flame war after writing his essay
"[Why I am Not Going to Buy a Computer](http://home.btconnect.com/tipiglen/berrynot.html)"
back in 1987). I ate my risotto out of a bowl that was hand made,
though I don't know by whom, that I picked out at the Empty Bowls
charity event I attended on campus last semester. Along with the
risotto I had some lentil soup (which I'm sorry to say only came from
the organic section of Food Lion) served in a bowl that was hand made
by a friend.

In his 1986 essay "A Defense of the Family Farm", Berry writes

People like to make things. We feel a deeper sense of connection
to others when we use tools and wear clothing made by someone's
hands. In this essay Berry is cautioning against losing this rich
tradition embodied in the family farm to the industrial agriculture
complex. Now, in 2013, it is sad to say his cautionary foresight was
well placed. Especially in the United States, and increasingly
elsewhere as our "efficient" agricultural methods spread, we have
become a society that is nearly thoroughly disconnected in all the
ways that matter from the one thing that our very survival depends on:
our food.

In his essay "As We May Think", Bush asked "What are the
scientists to do next". After the end of a scientific enlightenment of
sorts, brought on by the War he asked if we could turn the
tremendous scientific energy towards something more constructive. One
of the many results of the technological advancements made during the
war was a radical transformation in the way we grow (and subsequently
think about) our food. It had been know for some time that plants
needed at least nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium (N-P-K) to grow
(it turns out to grow _well_they need much more, but at the time, we
were patting ourselves on the back for unlocking the mysteries of
plant life). Once the war ended there was an abundance of nitrogen (a
component of TNT) that needed to be put to good use. The need was so
great that it was made available to farmers (in the form of ammonia)
for cheap, so cheap that it made economic sense to switch to this
commercial product instead of continue with the tried and true method
of spreading manure.

Along with this change came others. Because synthetic fertilizers
could be produced and transported and spread in large quantities, and
due to changes in the Farm Bill to promote food security farm sizes
grew and crop diversity shrank. With less diversity less skill was
needed and the number of family farms in the
U.S. [dropped dramatically](http://www.livinghistoryfarm.org/farminginthe50s/life_11.html),
from around 6 million immediately after WWII to just over 2 million in
the early 1990s. Earlier in the same essay Berry writes

> With industrialization has come a general deprication of work. As
> the price of work has gone up, the value of it has gone down, until
> it is now so depressed that people simply do not want to do it
> anymore. We can say without exaggeration that the present national
> ambition of the United States is unemployment.

This was 1987, remember. Our current job crisis is certainly more
complicated than the loss of family farms, but with the destruction of
4 million family farms came the loss of at least twice that many
skilled full-time jobs.

All in the name of industrial efficiency.

What's interesting though is like Berry said, we like making things
with our own hands. And we know we like making things with our own
hands, we just haven’t had much reason to after industrialization was
purported as a solution to all the drudgery involved in actually
practicing a skilled craft.

But like me and my hat, eating home-cooked food out of hand-made
bowls, food made with ingredients purchased directly from farmers, we
haven’t yet completely lost all our skills, they’ve just become
hidden. Something we practice in the privacy of our own home.

I am cautiously optimistic that yet another layer of technology may in
many ways help us build a stronger craft-based economy. Sites like
[Etsy](http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/shebang/page/3/#etsy.com) have given
artisans and people wanting to buy artisanal products a means to
connect directly, without going through a middleman, eliminating an
undesirable layer of indirection between the products we use and the
people who made them.

Can the Internet help us reconnect with what we truly value: each other?
