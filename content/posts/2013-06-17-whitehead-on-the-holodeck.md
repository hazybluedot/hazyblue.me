There are many reasons LEGOs [cost as much as they do](http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/08/24/why-are-legos-so-expensive/), one is the precious manufacturing that allows the bricks to be assembled and disassembled with ease:

In a similar way, rules dictating the form and structure of folk tales enabled bards to tell and pass down stories through generations. Though each telling is different from another, and can be tailored to the individual temperaments of the audience and bard, the essence remains intact.

Ancient bards and their bag of tricks is one area explored by Janet Murray in her expedition through the future landscape of narratives in cyberspace in _Hamlet on The Holodeck_.

Given the unique combinations of traits exhibited by the computer: encyclopedic knowledge base, navigable space, agency, the medium is esspecially suited for _interactive_ narratives: stories in which the reader is more of an active participant. Think [Choose Your Own Adventure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure) without the limitations of the physical pages and structure of a book.

As I was reading about the future of interactive narrative, and reminiscing about my own experiences with Choose Your Own Adventure, I realized that an interactive narrative is a really good framework for thinking about a curriculum. There may be a high level plot that covers some important points, but specific details and crucially, the path taken from start to end should be left to the participant.

In exploring the possibilities for interactive narrative and new forms
Janet Murray looks to the past at the bardic traditions used to
preserve stories before written language (emphasis my own):

> The stories are composed anew for each recitation and are therefore
> multiform, with no single canonical version. Every performance of a
> story varies from all others, reflecting the *interest of the
> audience* and the *dramatic interpretation of the
> storyteller*. <cite>Janet Murray</cite>

The bardic system, she says, serves to preserve the underlying
patterns associated with a story through tellers and generations, but
not a particular arrangement of words. This was made possible by
employing a relatively small set of formula "starting at the level of
the phrase and moving through the organization of the story as a
whole."[^murray]

[^murray]: Janet Murray, _Hamlet on the Holodeck_, 1997

So formulaic in fact that Vladimir Propp, a Russian formalist, was
able to reduce 450 Russian fairy tales into variants of a single story
by utilizing 25 basic plot events, which Murray refers to as "Propp's
essential morphemes", some of which are [^propp]

[^propp]: Propp, Morphology of the Folk Tale

(A)
: The villain causes harm or injury to a member of the family.

(a)
: One member of the family either lacks something or desires something

(up arrow)
: The hero leaves home

(D)
: The hero is tested (ten variants ranging from request for help to challenges to fight)

an onward. Most of the elements will be familiar to anyone from any
culture, as many of the themes are common to all story
traditions. Propp goes on to show that more than just an encyclopedic
store of the essential morphemes are needed and in fact there are a
set of rules that dictate how they are combined, when a substitution
is allowed, and the order in which subplots may occur.

Rather than restrict the storyteller,

> Propp's analysis makes clear that the formulaic underpinning makes
> folktales more intricate; it allows storytellers to weave together
> multiple different story sequences without becoming
> confused. <cite>Janet Murray</cite>

This idea really clicked for me. I like the at-first-glance
paradoxical conclusion, that making restrictions can provide freedom, just like the rigorously enforced dimensions of LEGO bricks.

To some extent, existing educational curricula already define
something like an algorithm for a larger narrative, or
structured blocks that can be assembled in a variety of ways. The
curriculum defines which educational modules must be part of the
larger degree, and defines a sequence that should be followed.  How
the content is presented in each course is largely up to the
instructor, the bard. However, because the larger story, that of the
degree, is not told by a single bard the resulting experience for the
audience is one of disjointed "scraps of information", the very things
Alfred Whitehead says have nothing to do with education:

> Culture is activity of thought, and receptiveness to beauty and
> human feeling. Scraps of information have nothing to do with it. A
> merely well-informed man is the most useless bore on God's
> earth. <cite>A.N. Whitehead[^aims_of_education1]</cite>


Whitehead dicusses three stages of mental growth

The Stage of Romance
: a sense of wonder

The Stage of Precision
: formalizing

The Stage of Generalization 
: a period of synthesis and return to romanticism

and suggests that these stages occur in a natural cycle when allowed
to, such as in the development of language. He also suggests that
these stages provide the framework for general education:

> Education should consist in a continual repetition of such
> cycles. Each lesson in its minor way should form an eddy cycle
> issuing in its own subordinate process. Longer periods should issue
> in definite attainments, which then form the starting-grounds for
> fresh cycles. <cite>A.F. Whitehead[^aims_of_education2]</cite>

[^aims_of_education1]: A.F. Whitehead, The Aims of Education
[^aims_of_education2]: A.F. Whitehead, The Aims of Education, p. 19

Propp reverse engineered a set of rules that dictate how predefined
story elements may be combined to form a customizable, coherent fairy
tale. Could we do something similar for university courses using
Whitehead's three stage cycle as a blueprint?

If we look at the resolution of the university course each course
would have to connect with others in the same term such that while
students are experience the stage of romance in one they may be
practicing the skills associated with the stage of precion in another
while generalizing a topic to other subjects in yet a third. The
generalization of a topic would lead directly into the stage of
romance of one or more new topics. This type of synergy between
courses would require close communication between instructors, or at
least more communication than currently takes place. Since the
solution to that particular problem likely would require some
administrative changes I want to focus at the level of an individual
course instead, one in which a single instructor has more direct
control over content and delviery and subtopics.

At this level, topics of one area of study may be distributed
throughout the semester.
