In exploring the possibilities for interactive narrative and new forms
of expression in the digital age, Murray looks into the past at the
bardic traditions common before written language (emphasis my own):

> The stories are composed anew for each recitation and are therefore
> multiform, with no single canonical version. Every performance of a
> story varies from all others, reflecting the *interest of the
> audience* and the *dramatic interpretation of the
> storyteller*. <cite>Janet Murray</cite>

The bardic system, she says, serves to preserve the underlying
patterns associated with a story through tellers and generations, but
not a particular arrangement of words. This was made possible by
employing a relatively small set of formula "starting at the level of
the phrase and moving through the organization of the story as a
whole."[^murray]

[^murray]: Janet Murray, _Hamlet on the Holodeck_, 1997

So formulaic in fact that Vladimir Propp, a Russian formalist, was
able to reduce 450 Russian fairy tales into variants of a single story
by utilizing 25 basic plot events, which Murray refers to as "Propp's
essential morphemes", some of which are (Try and find original source: Propp, Morphology of the Folktale)

(A)
: The villain causes harm or injury to a member of the family.

(a)
: One member of the family either lacks something or desires something

(up arrow)
: The hero leaves home

(D)
: The hero is tested (ten variants ranging from request for help to challenges to fight)

an onward. Most of the elements will be familiar to anyone from any
culture, as many of the themes are common to all story
traditions. Propp goes on to show that ore than just an encyclopedic
store of the essential morphemes are needed and in fact there are a
set of rules that dictate how they are combined, when a substitution
is allowed, and the order in which subplots may occur.

Rather than restrict the storyteller,

To some extent existing educational curricula already define something
that looks like an algorithm for a larger narrative. The curriculum
defines which educational modules must be part of the larger degree,
and defines a sequence that should be followed.  How the content is
presented in each course is largely up to the instructor, the
bard. However, because the larger story, that of the degree, is not
told by a single bard the resulting experience is one of disjointed
"scraps of information", the very things Afred Whitehead says have
nothing to do with education:

> Culture is activity of thought, and receptiveness to beauty and
> human feeling. Scraps of information have nothing to do with it. A
> merely well-informed man is the most useless bore on God's
> earth. <cite>A.N. Whitehead</cite>

where "culture" is the desired outcome of an education.
