There are many reasons LEGOs
[cost as much as they do](http://www.dailyfinance.com/2011/08/24/why-are-legos-so-expensive/),
one is the precise manufacturing that allows the bricks to be
assembled and disassembled with ease:

In a similar way, rules dictating the form and structure of folk tales
enabled bards to tell and pass down stories through
generations. Though each telling is different, and can be
tailored to the individual temperaments of the audience and bard, the
essence remains intact.

Bards and their bag of tricks is one area explored in _Hamlet on The Holodeck_, Janet
Murray's expedition through the future landscape of narratives in
cyberspace.

Siting that digital environments are:

- procedural
- participatory
- spatial
- encyclopedic

Murray states that these four properties "separately and collectively
make [the computer] a powerful vehicle for literary creation." The
medium is esspecially suited for _interactive_ narratives: stories in
which the reader is an active participant. Think
[Choose Your Own Adventure](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choose_Your_Own_Adventure)
without the limitations of the physical pages and structure of a book.

As I was reading about the future of interactive narrative, and
reminiscing about my own experiences with Choose Your Own Adventure, I
realized that an interactive narrative is a really great framework for
thinking about an educational curriculum. There may be a high level
"plot" or sequence of plot elements that should remain consistent, but
specific details and crucially, the path taken from start to end
should be left to the participant.

On the bardic traditions used to preserve stories before written
language Murray writes (emphasis my own),:

> The stories are composed anew for each recitation and are therefore
> multiform, with no single canonical version. Every performance of a
> story varies from all others, reflecting the *interest of the
> audience* and the *dramatic interpretation of the
> storyteller*. <cite>Janet Murray</cite>

The bardic system, she says, serves to preserve the underlying
patterns associated with a story through tellers and generations, but
not a particular arrangement of words. This is made possible by
employing a relatively small set of formula "starting at the level of
the phrase and moving through the organization of the story as a
whole."[^murray]

[^murray]: Janet Murray, _Hamlet on the Holodeck_, 1997

So formulaic in fact that Vladimir Propp, a Russian formalist, was
able to reduce 450 Russian fairy tales into variants of a single story
by utilizing 25 basic plot events, which Murray refers to as "Propp's
essential morphemes", some of which are [^propp]

[^propp]: Propp, Morphology of the Folk Tale

(A)
: The villain causes harm or injury to a member of the family.

(a)
: One member of the family either lacks something or desires something

(up arrow)
: The hero leaves home

(D)
: The hero is tested (ten variants ranging from request for help to challenges to fight)

an onward. Most of the elements will be familiar to anyone from any
culture, as many of the themes are common to all story
traditions. Propp goes on to show that more than just an encyclopedic
store of the essential morphemes are needed and in fact there are a
set of rules that dictate how they are combined, when a substitution
is allowed, and the order in which subplots may occur.

Rather than restrict the storyteller,

> Propp's analysis makes clear that the formulaic underpinning makes
> folktales more intricate; it allows storytellers to weave together
> multiple different story sequences without becoming
> confused. <cite>Janet Murray</cite>

This idea really clicked for me. At first glance it seems like a
paradox: restriction of action provides freedom. But often the paradox
is just an illusion: the rigorously enforced dimensions of LEGO bricks
enable, rather then hinder, the creative freedom of the builder.  And it is interesting to note that rule creative narrative has played in the success of the iconic interconnecting bricks:

> Sales of these products have been huge for Lego. More important, the
> experience has taught the company that what kids wanted to do with
> the blocks was tell stories. Lego makes or licenses the stories they
> want to tell. <cite>[Why Legos Are So Expensive â€” And So Popular](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2012/12/13/167055503/why-legos-are-so-expensive-and-so-popular)</cite>

So pieces that are designed to fit together can be used to tell
stories. Through my (albeit limited) experience exploring these ideas,
the stories talked about, both in _Hamlet on the Holodeck_ and those
licensed by LEGO, have been fictional. It goes without saying that
creating a great fictional narrative which explores the human
condition takes a great deal of creativity and genius. But what about
creating a story that tells of the interconnections between branches
and mathematics and sciences, stories that are written to help readers
gain an understanding of a particular field of study. Could the
techniques and ideas previously discussed be applied to the stories
told in academic institutions. Can we devise a set of algorithms and
story elements that will bestow individual instructors and students
the creative freedom to tailor stories to their own particular
strengths and interests, as well current events in a dynamic world,
while maintaining some level of consistency across instructors and
institutions so that while the words may not be the same, the story is
the same.

To some extent, existing educational curricula already define
something like an algorithm for a larger narrative, or structured
blocks that can be assembled in a variety of different ways. The
curriculum defines which modules/topics must be part of the larger
degree, and defines a sequence to followed. How the content is
presented in each course is largely up to the individual instructor,
the bard. However, because the larger story, that of the degree, is
not told by a single bard the resulting experience for the audience is
all too often one of disjointed "scraps of information", the very
thing Alfred Whitehead says has nothing to do with education:

> Culture is activity of thought, and receptiveness to beauty and
> human feeling. Scraps of information have nothing to do with it. A
> merely well-informed man is the most useless bore on God's
> earth. <cite>A.N. Whitehead[^aims_of_education1]</cite>

Whitehead dicusses three stages of mental growth:

The Stage of Romance
: "the subject-matter has the vividness of novelty; it holds within
itself unexplored connexions with possibilities half-disclosed by
glimpses and half-concealed by the wealth of material"

The Stage of Precision
: "In this stage, width of relationship is subordinated to exactness of formulation. It is the stage of grammar, the grammar of language and the grammar of science."

The Stage of Generalization 
: "The final stage of generalisation is [Hegel's synthesis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thesis,_antithesis,_synthesis). It is a return to romanticism with added advantage of classified ideas and relevant technique."

and suggests that these stages occur in a natural cycle when allowed
to, such as in the development of language. He also suggests that
these stages provide the framework for general education:

> Education should consist in a continual repetition of such
> cycles. Each lesson in its minor way should form an eddy cycle
> issuing in its own subordinate process. Longer periods should issue
> in definite attainments, which then form the starting-grounds for
> fresh cycles. <cite>A.F. Whitehead[^aims_of_education2]</cite>

[^aims_of_education1]: A.F. Whitehead, The Aims of Education, p. 1
[^aims_of_education2]: A.F. Whitehead, The Aims of Education, p. 19

Propp reverse engineered a set of rules that dictate how predefined
story elements may be combined to form a customizable, coherent fairy
tale, which in the oral tradition, is tailored to the particular
personalities of audience and performer. Could we do something similar
for university courses using Whitehead's three stage cycle as a
blueprint?

Starting from the third in the cycle, the stage of generalization
specifically addresses the question of interconnections. It is in this
stage in which the work down in the stage of precision is generalized
to other topics and fields. Would it be reasonable to say that all
topics/courses/degree programs should conclude with a stage of
generalization so that the story can continue in any of a number of
future directions, beginning with a new stage of romance? It would
then follow that all topics/courses/degrees would start with a stage
of romance that would provide a seamless transition from any number of
prior generalizations that different students may enter with.

Whitehead is careful to point out that his three stages shouldn't be
taken as absolute, rigorously defined partitions, and that elements of
all three stages of thinking should be present throughout a learning
experience. But by consciously emphasizing certain stages at key parts
in the educational cycle, might we create educational "bricks" that
can be assembled in highly personalized configurations for each
student? I'm not quite sure what this would look like on a large
scale, but have some ideas of how I would implement it in my own
course which I will cover in a future post. I'd be interested to hear
the views of others, particularly those who have more experience in
less technical areas.  Does the idea of trying to apply a structure
and a set of rules to create curriculum building blocks sound
ridiculous in less rigorous and technical fields than electrical
engineering and software design?

them to me directly and I'll publish them as comments once I get a
system working.
