[Mindstorms: Children, Computers and Powerful Ideas][Mindstorms] was
written by Seymour Papert in 1980 at the dawn of the personal computer
revolution. I had the pleasure of reading an excerpt from the book
published in The New Media Reader for a class.  I immediately
identified with what he wrote about programming as a tool to think
about how to think.  He predicted that the future ubiquity of
computers might spark a revlotion in the learning
process. Unfortunately, I was also struck by how little of what he
hoped for has come to pass, even over 30 years since the writing,
while his predictions of the increase in affordability, ubiquity and
power of personal computers has come to be a reality. His critics have
largely been correct in their predictions that computers would be used
to replace exiting teaching practices of drills and tests rather than
be exploited to change the way learning and teaching was done. But
why?

The challenges were not technical, [Papert] demonstrated practical
applications of his ideas with the LOGO programming language and a
mobile drawing device known as "the turtle" in several successful
pilot cases in the early 80s, during which time computers were slowly
trickling into the classroom. So why didn't this ideas take hold?

Papert's vision for a computer driven transformation in education
probably sounded quite insane to many when he started writing about
children using computers for learning and creativity in the 1960s,
when computers still filled rooms and were hardly "personal." Yet, he
predicted with advances in technology and manufacturing, computers
would become so cheap that every child could own one.

He saw the computer as a tool to think about thinking. To program a
computer to do a useful task, one must have the ability to reason
about the task, break it down into discrete steps, think about how
they would complete the task, and then think about how the computer
can be told to complete it using the commands it can understand.  This
idea is nothing new to any programmer alive today: knowing the words
of a programming language is about as useful as knowing just the
vocabulary of a spoken language.  To turn words into meaningful
sentences the speaker must be aware of context, nuance, and above all,
be able to model, if even subconsciously, how the receiver of her
words will be interpreted by a listener.

Unfortunately, while most people today walk around with more computing
power in their pocket than landed on the moon in 1969, they don't see
their personal computers the way Papert does.  Computers (and I'm
including mobile devices) have become so ubiquitous, with so many
layers of software between the hardware and the user that most users
aren't thinking of the device in their hands, or in front of them on
their desk as a powerful, general purpose computational machine.  They
view computers as a phone, or an address book, or a word processor
(which, let's be clear, most offer little more functionality than a
typewriter with a "save" feature).

Yes, computers and the internet have transformed the way we interact
with each other, with our data, and have transformed the way we do
business. But they have yet to have any kind of large scale impact in
the way we learn or think.  While we started to integrate computers in
the classroom in the early 80s it didn't take long before the system
reacted to this intrusion and attack on the status quo by confining
computers to the computer lab, out of the classroom, physically
separated from the learning environment which Papert hoped they would
transform. In the labs computers are used mainly to take notes, solve
equations, plot data, or simulate a typewriter to write papers. All
tasks we were already doing, albeit much slower.

MOOCs are certainly a new experience, made possible by ubiquitous
computing and the internet, but while MOOCs have certainly allowed
many people to attend classes who might otherwise not be able to
attend a brick and mortar institution, they leverage the awesome
technology now available as just a tool to allow easy scaling of the
lecture/exam model, rather than exploiting the potential to engage our
creativity and extend and challenge the way we think and solve
problems.

Even with all this technology at our finger tips, we are still stuck
with the method of education invented at a time when books were so
expensive that a university could afford to buy a copy, and professors
would read the book back to a classroom of students. It should come as
no surprise that our word "lecture" comes from the Latin **lectus**Â¸
past participle of **legere**, "to read".

Papert recognizes this tendency to use new technology to mimic old
technology in a piece he wrote as an appendix to a Proposal to the
National Science Foundation in 1972.

> There must in the world be tens of thousands of people struggling to
> understand what happens in a classroom where children are asked to
> do sums with pencil on square paper. Some of them try to improve
> matters by having the children do the same sums on computer
> terminals.

Unfortunately, this is the world we now live in, one which Papert
warned us about if we didn't act quickly:

> Time is of the essence. New technologies **will** diffuse into the
> schools and in the absence of available well-tried methods, untried
> ones will become established. And if this happens society will have
> to pay for one more expensive case of that bind which paradoxically
> places the major cost of innovation in the undoing of the old rather
> than the construction of the new. --
> http://www.papert.org/articles/AnEvaluativeStudyofModernTechnology.html

What ended up happening was just what many skeptics feared.  Like a
live organism fighting off a foreign threat, the school environment
quickly quarantined computers, removing them from the classroom and
isolating them as their own topic:

> Thus, instead of cutting across and so challenging the very idea of
> subject boundaries, the computer was now defined as a new subject;
> instead of changing the emphasis from impersonal curriculum to
> excited live exploration by students, the computer was now used to
> reinforce standard hierarchical thinking. What had started as a
> subversive instrument of change was neutralized by the system and
> converted into an instrument of consolidation. The development of
> computer labs seems to me a kind of immune response by School to a
> foreign body; the logic of the process was to bring the intruder
> back into line with School's ways. -- The Children's Machine

Now the big question: how do we fix it?  We are so comfortable using
computers to grill, test, and practice it's hard to convince anyone to
do anything else with them.  Attacked by the "[QWERTY syndrome]" from one
side, and shrinking budgets on the other, those of us who hope for
innovation fear we are fighting an uphill battle. Better funded
schools would help, certainly, as well as a reduction in
[the emphasis on standardized tests][problems-created-by-standardized-testing].

There's more freedom to get creative and take more risks in teaching
at the college level, but by that time we're faced with first
convincing learners to unlearn bad habits and assumptions about how to
solve problems, which is a tough task for any educator, even more
challenging given the time constraints faculty have when juggling
their research, teaching and service responsibilities.

So this is another one of those "I don't know what the best solution
is", but I have a feeling it's going to take many of us working
together to shake up the system a bit,
[integrate computer science as a core component][dontlearntocode] at
all educational levels and tackle some of the
[new pedagogical challenges][delugeofdata] that computers/technology
have presented.
