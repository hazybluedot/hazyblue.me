#+HTML_CONTAINER: div
#+HTML_HTML5_FANCY:

I started playing around with [[http://sozi.baierouge.fr/wiki/en:welcome][Sozi]], a plugin for [[http://inkscape.org][Inkscape]] that
generates interactive presentations in the standard, open [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics][SVG]] format.
The UI is still pretty young, so it's a little clunky but I was able
to generate something with prezi-like qualities:

- create a predefined sequence of frames that can be advanced forward and back
- click on objects to zoom to that frame out of sequence

Instructions: click on any of the nodes to zoom to that frame.  Once you have clicked one on the embedded SVG you will be able to use the left/right arrow keys to advance the frame forward/backward. Click and drag to scroll around. If you have a middle mouse button that will bring up the table of contents.

#+BEGIN_HTML
<iframe height="350" width="500" src="/assets/posts/tech_in_education.svg" /> <br/>
<a href="/assets/posts/tech_in_education.svg">Full Screen</a>
#+END_HTML

#+BEGIN_COMMENT
<embed height="350" width="500" src="/assets/posts/tech_in_education.svg" type="image/svg+xml" /> <br/>
#+END_COMMENT

There is also an option to embed video or audio that can be triggered
to play when a frame is reached. This might work well for narration.

The real power comes from the fact that this is a standard SVG
file. The Sozi player is a collection of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript][JavaScript]] functions that
interact with the SVG [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_Object_Model][DOM]]. JavaScript is able to query the DOM of the
SVG just as easily as the page itself. This means it should be
possible to create [[http://www.w3.org/TR/SVGTiny12/interact.html#UIEvents][interactions between presentation and page content]],
e.g. clicking on frames could bring up some overlay text, or clicking
on links in the text of the page could zoom to a frame, or even toggle
the visibility of specific objects. The possibilities are nearly
endless, but it's unlikely that the existing Sozi interface will
incorporate page interactions. Since it is a plugin for [[http://inkscape.org/][Inkscape]] it
can only reasonably know about components in the SVG itself. But SVG
is an open format and [[https://github.com/senshu/Sozi][Sozi]] is open source, perhaps someone will write
an interface for Sozi/HTML5 interactions.  I guess this is a good
excuse for me to [[http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/javascript][learn some JavaScript]]!
