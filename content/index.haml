    This site is still under heavy development. I am in the process of transfering old posts from the [old site](http://blogs.lt.vt.edu/shebang) to this location. I have not decided how I want to handle commenting yet, so for the time being tweet your comments with a url to the post.

- sorted_articles.each do |post|
  - if post[:published]
    %section
      %header
        %h1 
          = link_to(post[:title], post.path)
        Posted at: 
        %time{:pubtime => true, :datetime => "#{post[:created_at]}"}
          = get_pretty_date(post)

      = get_post_start(post)
